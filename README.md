## Project Description

Our project is a Star Wars themed online retail site that combines both the shopping and listing experience of such sites as Amazon and eBay where users can create and purchase each others' listings on the site.

When first arriving at the site, users are greeted with some CSS animation simulating the classic Star Wars opening. Users then have the option to either create a new account or login in to their preexisting account if they have one. Once signed in, the profile page is displayed with their pertinent profile information, most notably how many credits they have to spend. A sidebar presents a button that allows them to return to this same profile page at any time as well as an update page which allows users to change their species as well as give themselves a new profile picture.

Additionally, there are two buttons which take users to either the marketplace or the inventory. The marketplace page displays all items in the marketplace available for sale, showing an image of the product, the name, the description, the price, and the category in which the item belongs. Hovering over the item allows the user to add the item to his cart, located just beneath the sidebar. This cart bar displays the items the user adds to the cart in addition to the prices and the total price. Whenever the use is ready to check out, they can click on the blue checkout button below and the cost of their items will be deducted from their credits purse. If they do not have enough credits to buy the items, the checkout button turns into a red warning div saying, "Not Enough Credits". Once the user presses the checkout button, he is redirected to the inventory items page, where all the items the user has bought is displayed. Returning to the profile page reveals that the costs have been deducted from the user's account.

One way that a user can make money back is by posting listings of his own. On the marketplace page, the user can press the "Add Item" button to bring forth a form for users to create their own items for the marketplace. Doing so binds the user as the item owner, meaning that when another user buys that item, the owner receives the payment. Similarly, items which the user purchases for their inventory are also automatically added to the marketplace. In this way, users are able to buy and create classic Star Wars items through our credits shopping system and item-user relations.
